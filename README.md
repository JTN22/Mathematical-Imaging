# 🧠 Mathematical Imaging

This repository contains a collection of scripts and functions developed for a **Mathematical Imaging** course. The exercises explore foundational techniques in image processing, using both **Python** and **MATLAB**.

> 🧪 This project was completed as part of an academic course focused on applying mathematical concepts to visual data, including filtering, enhancement, Fourier analysis, and edge detection.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Python** (NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib)
- **MATLAB** (.m files for matrix/image computation)
- No external dependencies required for most scripts

## 🗂️ Categories of Scripts

### 📊 Image Analysis & Statistics
- `average.m` — Averages pixel values
- `median.py` — Applies median filtering
- `histogram.py` — Plots or computes image histograms
- `intensityreduction.py` — Reduces grayscale intensity levels

### 🎨 Enhancement & Filtering
- `he.py` — Histogram equalization
- `glowpass.py`, `ghighpass.py` — Low-pass and high-pass filters
- `laplacian.py`, `gradient.py` — Edge detection methods

### 🧮 Transformations
- `geometric.m`, `arithmetic.m`, `linear.py` — Basic pixel-wise operations
- `cst.py` — Custom transformation function
- `fourierspectrum.m`, `sinusoidal.m` — Frequency domain / Fourier-based processing

### 🖼️ Experimental & Misc
- `hem.py` — Possibly related to histogram equalization (manual?)
- `snra.m`, `snrg.m` — Likely simulate signal-to-noise ratio variations
- `he.py`, `geometric.m` — Manual implementations of basic enhancement
